# Vigilance-Adaptation---Adaptive-Resonance-Theory

Python implementation of clustering algorithms developed in "Vigilance adaptation in adaptive resonance theory" and theoretically demonstrated in "Adaptive Scaling of Cluster Boundaries for Large-Scale Social Media Data Clustering". 

Comparing to the base model, i.e. adaptive resonance theory (ART), the three algorithms, AM-ART, CM-ART and HI-ART, 1) self-adapt the vigilance parameter that controls the intra-cluster similarity and 2) allow each cluster to have its own vigilance value.  

If you find the algorithms interesting, please feel free to look through and distribute the papers below:
